Handling Missing Values and Data Cleaning

Project Overview: Work with datasets containing missing values, such as sales data or survey responses.
Steps:
Load data using Pandas (pd.read_html() or pd.read_excel()).
Visualize missing data patterns using Seaborn heatmaps (sns.heatmap() with null masks).
Implement techniques such as:
Filling missing values (fillna()) with mean, median, or mode.
Dropping incomplete rows/columns (dropna()).
Using advanced imputation techniques like interpolation.
Outcome: A cleaned dataset ready for accurate analysis and visualization.
Pivot Table Creation and Analysis

Project Overview: Create and analyze pivot tables to summarize categorical and numerical data, such as sales by region or user activity by time.
Steps:
Generate pivot tables using Pandas (pd.pivot_table()).
Visualize aggregated data using:
Bar charts (Matplotlib or Seaborn’s sns.barplot()) to compare categories.
Heatmaps to highlight trends and outliers in pivoted data.
Automate insights by grouping data based on conditions like time, geography, or demographics.
Outcome: Pivot tables paired with visualizations that provide actionable insights.
Advanced Data Visualizations

Correlation and Relationship Analysis:
Use pairplots and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables (e.g., sales vs. profit or temperature vs. energy usage).
Trend Analysis:
Create line plots to showcase time-based trends using Matplotlib.
Categorical Data Analysis:
Visualize distribution using Seaborn’s boxplots, violin plots, and count plots for categorical insights.
Data Distributions:
Analyze distributions with histograms for continuous data.
